        <div>This website is designed to help health care professionals to learn telemetry and understand the science behind the heart. We will discuss the basic anatomy and physiology behind the heart, the basics of telemetry, measuring telemetry, how to interpret telemetry rhythms, and we will go over all the rhythms. Before we talk about the heart and rhythms, we want to know what the terminology behind the words used are. 
            <br>
            <h3>Terminology</h3>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Cardiac cycle : depolarization and repolarization of the heart muscle in a cyclic fashion resulting in a heart contraction which generates a pulse of blood and perfusion of tissues
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Baseline : isoelectric (flat) tracing of electrical energy, measured in time left to right
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Waves : electrical energy measured as moving toward a positive electrode (upward waveform) or toward the negative electrode (downward waveform) measured from point departing baseline to point returning to baseline (may be elevated or depressed relative to baseline at start of waveform)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Biphasic waves : complex which have both positive and negative waves before returning to a baseline tracing
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Automaticity : the characteristic of building an electrical potential resulting in release of a signal which through transmission results in muscular contraction (a pacemaker), faster automaticity suppresses or overrides automaticity in tissues with lesser automaticity rates
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Ectopy : “out of place” beat originates from a site outside the normal (Sino-atrial node) pacemaker, a result of increased automaticity in the aberrant pacemaker
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Baseline : isoelectric activity represented by a line drawn left to right at a speed of 25 mm/sec
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Wave : a deflection either positive (upward) or negative (downward) from the baseline, beginning and end points on point leaving and returning to baseline
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Cardiac cycle : a series of waves labeled P, Q, R, S, T, & U (U waves infrequently noted in routine telemetry monitoring)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Interval : a time measured between two points on the ECG tracing
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Segment : a portion of the baseline between two waveforms
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Pacemaker : tissue that achieves inherent automaticity releasing an electrical signal resulting in electrical conduction and cardiac muscle contraction
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Artifact : signal which distorts telemetry data and interfers with accurate interpretation
                    </li>
                    <li> 
                        Heart Rate (HR): measurement of ventricular impulses per minute, normal adult heart rate 60-100 beats per minute (BPM)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Stroke Volume (SV) : amount of blood pumped by the ventricular contraction into circulation, measured in mL, represents a fraction of the total volume held by the ventricle (ejection fraction – normally 50-70% [AHA, 2020] of ventricular volume), normal 60-80 mL adult heart
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Cardiac Output (CO) : Heart Rate (HR) X Stroke Volume (SV) CO is a measure of the efficiency of the heart and represents the amount of blood pumped/minute, normal adult 4-8 L/min
                    </li>

            <h2>Anatomy of the heart</h2>
            <div>
                Knowing the anatomy and physiology of the heart is very important than just know how to identify different arrythmias.
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>While cardiac pacemakers generally are controlled by inherent automaticity this can be altered by the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems</li>
                        <li>The sympathetic nervous system (SNS) is the equivalent of “stepping on the gas.” SNS signals decreases the level of automaticity which increases heart rate and tissue recovery speed, at the micro-anatomy level it increases the speed of muscular contraction which increases stroke volume</li>
                        <li>The parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) is the equivalent of “stepping on the brake,” PNS stimulation increases automaticity of the atrial tissues resulting in slowing of atrial pacemakers but does not affect ventricular tissues where ventricular recovery speed affects stroke volume</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Conduction Pathway</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Sinoatrial Node (SN) : primary pacemaker, begins most cardiac cycles – signal travels to ...
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Atrioventricular Node (AV) : slows forward conduction to allow atria to complete contraction before the ventricular response, secondary pacemaker usually suppressed by faster rate of atrial pacemakers, signal passes along ...
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Bundle of HIS dividing into Right & Left Bundle branches ending in Purkinje fibers, this complex represents the tertiary pacemaker usually suppressed by faster pacemakers located in superior cardiac tissue
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Right & Left bundle braches transmits the signal through the myocardium of the ventricles
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Purkinje fibers delivers the signal to the individual myocardial fibers

                    <p>
                        Each normal cardiac cycle has a series of waves labeled with letters of the alphabet P-T in basic telemetry.
                        <ul>
                            <li>P wave: Atrial contraction</li>
                            <li>PR segment represents AV slowing</li>
                            <li>QRS Complex: Ventricular Contraction (a pulse when perfusion is present) the J point at the end of the S wave occurs where the direction of upward or downward travel in the QRS complex begins change to lateral movement</li>
                            <li>T wave: Ventricular repolarization (ventricular recovery) which must occur prior to the next ventricular contraction</li>
                        </ul>

            <h2>Measuring Telemetry</h2>
            <p>
                The PR Interval begins at the beginning of the P wave and ends at the next wave to leave the baseline (Q for a negative wave or R for a positive wave)
            </p>
            <p>
                The QRS Interval begins at the first wave after the P wave (if present) and ends at the J point (the point where the direction of travel of the final wave of the QRS complex changes direction from up/down tracing to mostly lateral movement)
            </p>
            <p>
                The QT Inverval begins at the beginning of the QRS complex and ends at the end of T wave
            </p>
            <p>
                The R-R interval is measured from the peaks of two adjacent QRS complexes represents the rate of heart contraction

        <div>
            <h3>Normal Intervals</h3>
            <p> When measuring and interpreting telemetry strips you want to make sure you are paying attention to the intervals (PR, QRS, QT,R-R, and the HR). If the intervals are outside the normal range than it can mean a different rhythm. It is very important to pay attention to these values. If you are looking over a pediatric patient's telemetry and they are under 12 years old then the values are different than the adult ages. We will discuss pediatric telemetry values as well.</p>
            <p>For adults patients the intervals are: 
                <ul>
                    <li> HR: 60-100 BPM</li>
                    <li>PR: .09-.20 seconds, three to five small boxes</li>
                    <li>QRS: .04-.12</li>
                    <li>QT: Normal values vary by age, gender, and heart rate but usually 0.35 to 0.45 seconds, when greater than 0.49 seconds Notify the physician. When prologned QT interval the cQT (corrected QR) interval will be measured.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <div>
                <h3>Measurement Tips</h3>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Choose an interval which either starts or ends on a dark (large box) line.</li>
                        <li>Use paper and pencil or caliper to measure the interval on a flat level left to right. If difficult to identify boxes at that point move the recorded measurement to a portion of the strip lined up with a dark line box and count boxes to second mark</li>
                        <li>Multiply the number of small boxes by 0.04 sec to find the interval length</li>
                    </ul>

            <h2>Interpreting Telemetry</h2>
           <div>
            <p>When interpreting telemetry you want to assess the rhythm and ask yourself questions.</p>
            <h4>Is the rhythm regular or irregular?</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Because of automaticity all pacemakers normally fire regularly</li>
                <li>If irregular is it because the rhythm includes early (premature ectopic) beats</li>
                <li>If irregular is it because of a missing beat(s)</li>
                <li>If irregular is the rhythm inherently irregular (no pattern to cardiac cycles)</li>
            </ul>
            <img src="./assets/images/regular-or-irregular.png" alt="regular-or-irregular">
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>Assess the rate</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Six second rule: count the number of events being measured in a six second rhythm strip and multiple by 10 for minute rate, may be used for any rhythm regular or irregular</li>
                    <li>Box method : count the number of large boxes between measured event and divide into 300 – 1 box = 300/minute, 2 box = 150/minute, 3 box = 100/minute ... may only be used in a regular rhythm</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Tachycardia: rate greater than 100 bpm, or less than 3 large boxes</li>
                        <li>Normal rate: 60-100 bpm, or 3-5 large boxes</li>
                        <li>Bradycardia: Less than 60 bpm, or greater than 5 large boxes</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>Cardiac Cycle</h4>
                <p>
                    P waves 
                    <ul>
                        <li>P waves represent atrial depolarization (contraction)</li>
                        <li>Morphology: usually upright in Lead II, consistent shape</li>
                        <li>Changes in the P wave and PR interval indicate conduction of the atria</li>
                    </ul>
                    PR Interval
                    <ul>
                        <li>Short PR interval indicates less time taken to travel through atrial pathways and distance traveled thus shorter than normal, short PR interval indicates an atrial ectopic pacemaker</li>
                        <li>Normal, consistent PR interval validates cardiac cycle originates in the sinus node, “normal” beat</li>
                        <li>Long PR interval indicates prolonged AV slowing, an AV block</li>
                    </ul>
                    P:QRS ratio

            <h3>Atrial Rhythms</h3>
            <p>P waves and PR segment identify the atrial conduction pathways of cardiac cycles</p>
            <p>Changes in the PR interval provide the identifying characteristics of the various atrial arrhythmias</p>
            <p>Atrial rates are affected by both sympathetic and parasympathetic stimulation of the CNS</p>
            <p> Atrial Rhythm Characteristics</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Atrial arrhythmias arise from alternate pacemakers within atrial tissues, therefore the morphology and characteristics of the P wave will be altered due to variant atrial pathways</li>
                <li>P waves may be notched, demonstrate biphasic patterns, or exhibit other morphological changes related to alternate pathways</li>
                <li>AV response may also be affected by alternate entry patterns between different transmission pathways and electrical patterns</li>
                <li>The most chaotic and dysrhythmic appearance will be related to fibrillating impulses (fibrillation = individual cells reach automaticity and fire in an uncoordinated fashion with respect to other adjacent cells – the muscle is quivering)</li>
